###Introduction To Arrays:
In C programming, one of the frequently problem is to handle similar types of data. For example: if the
user wants to store marks of 500 students, this can be done by creating 500 variables individually but,
this is rather tedious and impracticable. These types of problem can be handled in C programming using
arrays.
An array in C Programing can be defined as number of memory locations, each of which can store the
same data type and which can be references through the same variable name. It is a collective name
given to a group of similar quantities. These similar quantities could be marks of 500 students, number
of chairs in university, salaries of 300 employees or ages of 250 students. Thus we can say array is a
sequence of data item of homogeneous values (same type). These values could be all integers, floats or
characters etc.
We have two types of arrays:
1. One-dimensional arrays.
2. Multidimensional arrays.
